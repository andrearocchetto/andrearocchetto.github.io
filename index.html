	<h2>Andrea Rocchetto</h2>
	<p></p>
	<p>I am the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.ephos.io">Ephos</a>, a photonic chip manufacturer.
	<p><p>
	<p>Before founding Ephos, I was an <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/andrea-rocchetto/">It from Qubit Simons Collaboration</a>  Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/">Scott Aaronson</a>.
	<p></p>	
	<p>Prior to that I was a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford advised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simoneseverini/">Simone Severini</a>, a Graduate Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, and a member of the UCL CS Quantum group  in the Department of Computer Science at University College London.
	<p></p>	
	<p>The interplay between physics and computation is at center of my work. I am particularly fascinated by modelling quantum mechanics with data-driven tools and exploring whether machine learning algorithms running on quantum computers can help us discover new physics. These questions where the focus of my PhD thesis, <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:63537c54-f080-49f7-b0c5-7417a2ef53af/files/m9e53052f94b6c5997b72db3795be0ccf:">Algorithmic Models in Quantum Mechanics</a>. All my research papers are available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Rocchetto%2C+A">arXiv</a>.</p>
